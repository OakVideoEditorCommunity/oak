   * create, this is where the code for that goes.
   *
   * Note that as a video editor, the node graph has to work across time. Depending on the purpose of your node, it may
   * output different values depending on the time, and even if not, it will likely be receiving different input
   * depending on the time. Most of the difficult work here is handled by NodeInput::get_value() which you should pass
   * the `time` parameter to. It will return its value (at that time, if it's keyframed), or pass the time to a
   * corresponding output if it's connected to one. If your node doesn't directly deal with time, the default behavior
   * of the NodeParam objects will handle everything related to it automatically.
